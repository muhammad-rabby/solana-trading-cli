## üö® Set Up 

Before you begin, ensure you have completed the following steps:

### 1. Environment Configuration

1. Locate the template file:
   ```
   src/helpers/.env.example
   ```

2. Copy this file and rename it to `.env` in the same directory.

3. Open the `.env` file and add the following required information:
   - Mainnet wallet secret key (required)
   - RPC endpoint (required)
   - Custom Jito fee (if needed)

4. Optional configurations:
   - Devnet wallet secret key
   - Shyft API key

### 2. API Keys and Wallet Setup

- **Mainnet Wallet**: Ensure you have a funded Solana mainnet wallet. The secret key is required for mainnet transactions.
- **RPC Endpoint**: Obtain a reliable RPC endpoint for connecting to the Solana network.
- **Jito Integration**: If using Jito, prepare your custom fee configuration.
- **Devnet Wallet** (Optional): For testing purposes, set up a devnet wallet.
- **Shyft API** (Optional): If you plan to use Shyft services, obtain an API key from [Shyft](https://shyft.to/).

### 3. Final Check

- Confirm that your `.env` file is properly configured and saved.
- Ensure the `.env` file is in the correct location: `src/helpers/.env`
- Verify that you haven't accidentally committed your `.env` file to version control.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Note**: Never share or commit your `.env` file or any private keys. The `.env` file is included in `.gitignore` for your safety.
